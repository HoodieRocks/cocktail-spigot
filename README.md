# Cocktail (spigot) :cocktail:

Cocktail is a Spigot plugin designed to expand the capabilities of Minecraft Datapacks via useful and powerful commands and utilities.

**Requires [CommandAPI](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/62353/)**

## Features

### Datapack Updater
Update your datapacks in a jiffy! Add your link to the config, and it'll download your datapacks updates on reload or start up

```YAML
datapack-name-here:
  # Make sure the link either redirects to a download page or is a direct link to a zip of the pack
  url: "https://your-datapack.link/here.zip"
```

### Advanced Commands
Cocktail adds many commands, these commands are accessible to datapacks unlike traditional Spigot commands.
- Use /velocity for velocity manipulation,
- Use /damage to damage exactly the specified damage to an entity,

*And many more commands!* (see the [wiki](https://github.com/HoodieRocks/cocktail/wiki))

### More to come!

## Disclaimers

- While this plugin can be used on Paper or its forks (Purpur, Pufferfish, Petal, etc.), [Paper is known for causing lots of issues with datapacks](https://github.com/search?q=extension%3Amcfunction+language%3Amcfunction+paper&type=issues) (more than Spigot)
